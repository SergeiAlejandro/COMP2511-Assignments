    It's always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike. 
    If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't have to worry. 
    Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to learn that day.
    I'm heading back to Colorado tomorrow after being down in Santa Barbara over the weekend 
    for the festival there. I will be making October plans once there and will try to arrange 
    so I'm back here for the birthday if possible. I'll let you know as soon as I know the 
    doctor's appointment schedule and my flight plans. The wave crashed and hit the sandcastle 
    head-on. The sandcastle began to melt under the waves force and as the wave receded, 
    half the sandcastle was gone. The next wave hit, not quite as strong, but still managed 
    to cover the remains of the sandcastle and take more of it away. The third wave, 
    a big one, crashed over the sandcastle completely covering and engulfing it. 
    When it receded, there was no trace the sandcastle ever existed and hours of hard work 
    disappeared forever.
